# The COONLAB Viscograph

## Employment
The COONLAB Viscograph is a worldwide standard instrument for measuring viscosity of starch and products containing starch. This instrument measures natural starches – wheat, corn, potato, and rice – as well as all modified types of starches. The examination process is highly efficient and provides the complete profile of rheological properties of the products:

* Gelatinization of starch and starch-containing foods and its characteristics
* Viscosity at low and high temperatures
* Stability of thickening agents and binders
* Acid stability of starch
* Extrudate testing
* Measurement of industrial starch
* Measurement of liquids, suspensions, pasty mass, etc.

## Operation principles
The sample is heated up within a rotating stainless steel bowl and cooled down again, both under controlled conditions. Together with the comfortable Windows software, the integrated, self-optimizing temperature controller allows programming and storage of any temperature profiles with heating/ cooling rates of 0.5...3 °C/min. A measuring sensor reaching into the sample is deflected according to the viscosity of the sample in the bowl. This deflection is measured as torque.

The test will provide you with a reliable and reproducible profile of rheological properties of your product - baking behaviour, thickening properties, low or high viscosity at low or high temperatures, stability, etc.

## Advantages

* Automatic testing procedure
* Multiple temperature programmes
* Heating/cooling rates of 0.5...3°C/min.
* Electronic speed control (0...300 min-1)
* Full-scale measurement range
* Automatic dimensional scaling of diagrams
* Results are presented in BU and mPa*min
* Three latest tests are stored in the instrument memory
* Results can be transmitted to the computer via USB
* Results can be printed
